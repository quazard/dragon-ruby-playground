# DragonRuby Playground

Small repo with some samples around the Game Engine [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.org/).

Each game sample contains a shell script called `run`, which requires the game engine to be part of `PATH` env variable in order to get executed correctly.

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/dragonruby-gtk-macos/dragonruby-macos"
```
